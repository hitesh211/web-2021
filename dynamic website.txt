Amazon Route 53 (Route 53) is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service. Released on December 5, 2010, [1] it is part of Amazon.com's cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The name is a possible reference to U.S. Routes[2] and 53 is a reference to the TCP/UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed.[3] In addition to being able to route users to various AWS services, including EC2 instances, Route 53 also enables AWS customers to route users to non-AWS infrastructure and to monitor the health of their application and its endpoints. Route 53's servers are distributed throughout the world.
